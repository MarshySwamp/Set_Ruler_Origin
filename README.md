# Set_Ruler_Origin
An Adobe Photoshop JavaScript to assist in setting the ruler origin point

Created for a user at the Adobe Photoshop Community Forum

**Version 1.0:**
Initial release, using two prompts for the user to enter X and Y pixel co-ordinates for the ruler origin point from the upper left of the canvas.

**Version 1.2:**
An alternative version using scriptUI to offer the selection of 9 preset canvas positions.

**Version 1.3:**
X & Y fields added. Radio buttons override the field entries. The intention/expectation is that either the radio buttons are used, or the fields are used instead - not both at the same time.
